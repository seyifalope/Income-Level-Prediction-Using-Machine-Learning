The aim of this report project is to have an in-depth understanding of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, along with Decision Trees and Random Forests. The main objective is to apply these models in predicting income levels and subsequently carry out a comparative analysis. This analysis will be rooted in the performance metrics of each model concerning the prediction of whether income surpasses $50K/yr based on census data.
